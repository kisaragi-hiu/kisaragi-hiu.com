I'm still not sure what I'm doing, and I continue to gain immense interest for stuff before losing interest in like a week or so. No meaningful progress have been made on drawing and music composition, two things that I occasionally feel that I /really/ want to learn before backing down.

I started using Org-roam last year, but this year I decided to fork Org-roam v1 when Org-roam v2 was released. This was mainly because I didn't feel like trying to add an ID to everything.
