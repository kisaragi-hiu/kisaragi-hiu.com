A typical pop song usually goes like:

A1, B1, R1, A2, B2, R2, Bridge, R3

- A: verse, Aメロ, 主歌
- B: Bメロ, buildup before refrains
- R: refrain, サビ, 副歌
- Bridge: the part connecting the last two refrains

[[file:utau-labels.org][I used to use “V1” to refer to the first verse]], and “V1-R1” to refer to the B part between the first verse and the first refrain. This has always felt clumsy, which is why I'm changing it again.

A1 B1 R1 Bridge
“Intro”, “Outro”
