Tried to sing バルーン's レディーレ.

I wanted to try to sing it the moment I saw the original, but it took me two weeks just to finish it…

This time I came back to using Ardour for mixing.

It felt like more hassle than Audacity at first as I don't see a way to directly do normalization, but it's way more convenient as it's possible to rerecord a section after effects have been applied, instead of having to redo all the effects.
