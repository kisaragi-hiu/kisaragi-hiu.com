When you load a VSQx into Piapro Studio (perhaps for tuning reference), it will follow the tempo from the VSQx instead of the tempo of the current DAW project.

This is a feature called tempo automation. To return to the DAW's tempo and meter settings, open the meter and tempo automation panel and turn them off.
