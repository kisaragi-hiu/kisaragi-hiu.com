I learned this view from 3blue1brown’s video, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULa9Lc4pck][Triangle of Power]], which sources from [[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/30046/alternative-notation-for-exponents-logs-and-roots][this Math StackExchange answer that invented this notation]].

While those sources explain this as an alternative notation, even without using it as a notation it is still a pretty useful conceptual tool.
