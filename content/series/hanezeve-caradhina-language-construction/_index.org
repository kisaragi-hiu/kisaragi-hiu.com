Hanezeve Caradhina is a song in the OST of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_Abyss][Made in Abyss]], composed by [[https://twitter.com/kevinpenkin][Kevin Penkin]] and sung by [[https://twitter.com/snare_saitou][斎藤洸 (Takeshi Saito)]].

Kevin Penkin, the composer, said this on what the lyrics meant:
