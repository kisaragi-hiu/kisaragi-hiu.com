* Projects

I think I made some projects that I'm reasonably proud of.

- [[file:projects/kemdict.org][Kemdict]] updates.

- [[https://nowww.tw][nowww.tw]], an attempt at an advocate site for Taiwanese websites to /please/ redirect their apex domains to their www subdomains.

- [[https://github.com/kisaragi-hiu/emacs-jieba][emacs-jieba]]. Jieba is a tokenizer for Mandarin; jieba-rs is a Rust implementation of it. emacs-jieba is a new Emacs Lisp binding to jieba-rs, allowing fast Mandarin tokenization in Emacs Lisp. Used for Kemdict.
