In East Asian names, the first part of a person’s name is their family name. This is unlike many other languages, which put family name last (to the point where “last name” is sometimes synonymous with “family name”).

When these names are translated, often they would be flipped over to match English conventions.

One has to consider the fact that they’re messing with someone’s name when doing this. It’s not a big problem, but I prefer not to do this.

Seeing these flipped names sometimes confuses me as well, as I’m used to their original forms.

Preserving this order respects different naming conventions.

This is really only a minor difference, so we shouldn’t be attacking people over this.
