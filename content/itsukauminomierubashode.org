I tried to cover いつか海の見える街で, and also made a simple lyrics video. The background was recorded during my graduation trip at the end of our train, as my class just happened to get assigned to the last train car.

The lyrics are set in Honoka Mincho, composited onto a glow + color ramp with the Alpha Over node in Blender. I accidentally deleted the .blend file for the lyrics images as I didn't realize Kdenlive wouldn't archive it.

My voice… is still terrible. I guess I just have to practice.

I should've make sure the fade in at the start begins after the music starts…
