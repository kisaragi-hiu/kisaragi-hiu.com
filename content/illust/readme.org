* Illustration entries

Each page here represents an illustration work, ie those that I post to Pixiv.

Filename is the published date in =yyyy-mm-dd=.

Frontmatter:

- title
- date (just the date)
- pixiv
- (maybe) tags
- (maybe) =roam_tags= for easier retrieval as part of my notes

Each page should also at least show the image itself.

+I haven’t figured out where to host them. I have a central place for them (kind of) in my private datastore, but for a public place I’m not sure.+

This file is excluded from being rendered by Hugo.

Files are hosted in =/static/illust/yyyy-mm-dd.jpg=. In effect, in the rendered output, the page and the file would be adjacent to each other. This is fine.

=/static/illust= will be a separate submodule.

** Todos

- List all illustrations
- Create a small (max 128x128) thumbnail for each illustrations, maybe preserving dimensions
- Show those thumbnails in the illust listing
  - Maybe with .File.BaseFileName
- Split by year
