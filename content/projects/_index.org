#+title: Projects

Software projects. Not a complete list, because if I force myself to go through the bureaucracy of registering an entry here before starting a project I'd stop wanting to do it.

The date denotes roughly when a project was started.

Beware that:

- I am subject to [[http://winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html][the Lisp Curse]] â€” specifically in regards to leaving stuff 80% or 60% complete after I scratched the initial itch to do it, not that my stuff would necessarily actually be at the level of an average lone wolf Lisp developer.
- I thus should mark which projects are actually /done/ or /usable/, but I haven't gotten around to do it either.
