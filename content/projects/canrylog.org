My own time tracker.

The core idea is that we simply track a list of events stating that from a moment onward, some task is currently active.

I want it to be available in many platforms, but so far there is only an Emacs version.

* Tracking file
The core tracking file looks like this:

#+begin_src canrylog-file
2019-01-15T22:40:18+0900  Entertainment:Gaming:osu!
2019-01-15T23:04:56+0900  Development:Canrylog:Emacs
2019-01-15T23:13:41+0800  Notes:Scheduling
2019-01-15T23:28:19+0800  SocialMedia:Youtube
2019-01-16T00:24:53+0800  Sleep
#+end_src

Each line represents a “task switching event”. Each line starts with a timestamp, a separator (two spaces), and a task name.

The task name can be broken down into a hierarchy, using a colon (=:=) to separate paths.

This tells us that the currently active task is =Sleep=, while =SocialMedia:Youtube= was active between 2019-01-15T23:28:19+0800 and 2019-01-16T00:24:53+0800. All timestamps are in [[/iso8601.org][ISO 8601]], sorted chronologically (taking the UTC offset into account).

* Emacs version

My usual workflow is:

- Use =canrylog-switch-task= to switch to something I’m doing or working on
- Switch to the task “Downtime” to signify that I’ve clocked out
- Use =canrylog-describe-task= to see a summary on a task
- Use =canrylog-view-main= (aliased to =canrylog=) to see my current task and how much time it’s been active for.

I’ve also built a task list view, although that’s something that isn’t really fleshed out just yet.

* Command line version

Currently the tracking file location is hard coded, as I’ve only been working on the current version for less than 3 hours.

Commands implemented:

- =canrylog switch-to <task>=
- =canrylog current=
