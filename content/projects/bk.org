Key-value pair storage based on JSON, intended for command line bookmarks.

The file can be specified with the environment variable =$BK_FILE=, otherwise it is =${XDG_DATA_HOME}/bk/bk.json= or =~/.local/share/bk/bk.json= by default.

- =bk --init= :: Initialize the key-value store. There is no need to do this manually.
- =bk <key>= :: Retrieve the value associated with =key=.
- =bk <key> <value>= :: Set the value associated with =key= to =value=.
- =bk -l= or =bk --list= :: List all existing keys
- =bk -d <key>= or =bk --delete <key>= :: Delete =key= from the key-value store
- =bk -h= or =bk --help= :: Show a help message.
