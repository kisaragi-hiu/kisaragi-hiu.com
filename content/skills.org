#+special: true

Maybe this is better suited in [[file:about.org][About]]. For now, I’m listing these here.

- Using Git since late 2014
- “Maintaining” a Linux system since 2014, self hosting stuff on Linode since 2019
- English, Mandarin, Japanese
- Some familiarity with Racket and Pollen
- Made this site in 2017 (see [[file:2020-10-31-infrastructure.org][2020-10-31 Current infrastructure of this site]] for how it’s set up)
- Good enough understanding of Emacs Lisp to develop packages helping myself
- UTAU covers

* Skills still being learned

My Japanese is still a work in progress. I can read pretty well, but my written and especially spoken Japanese are pretty broken.

My English writing is still kind of off.

I’m currently trying (and struggling) to learn to play the trumpet.

I’m also trying to learn to draw, though I haven’t been putting enough time into it.
