* Cover project listing

UTAU covers and maybe my own cover experiment.

Filename: date-name-origauthor, with spaces replaced with dashes

Frontmatter:

#+begin_src org
,#+title:
,#+origauthor:
,#+date:
,#+youtube:
,#+niconico:
,#+voice:
,#+tags[]:
#+end_src

- =voice= instead of =voicebank= (what I use internally) because this way it can also accomadate covers with my own voice.

** Listing
We can list them in individual fields, then display them like:

| title         | orig | vb     |
|---------------+------+--------|
| M.S.S.Phantom | MSSP | 夏語遙 |

in the listing, and like

#+begin_src text
M.S.S.Phantom / 夏語遙
original: MSSP
#+end_src

in the heading.
