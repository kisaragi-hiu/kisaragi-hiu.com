A standard for timestamps.

It is roughly =yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ=, where

- yyyy is the 4-digit year
- mm is the 2-digit month
- dd is the 2-digit day
- HH is the hour
- MM is the minute
- SS is the second
- and Z is the offset from UTC.

The offset from UTC is roughly written in this format:

- =Z= stands for UTC. It's also referred to as Zulu time.
- Otherwise, it's either =+HH:MM= or =-HH:MM=.

* Omitting the colon in the UTC offset

I tend to omit the colon in the UTC offset, but I'm not sure if this actually conforms to the standard.

Emacs does this by default:

#+begin_quote
For example, to produce full ISO 8601 format, use "%FT%T%z".

— Emacs docstring for =format-time-string=
#+end_quote

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(format-time-string "%FT%T%z") ; => 2021-06-07T20:21:18+0900
#+end_src

* Shortened version

As far as I remember, there is also a shortened version defined in the standard, which removes all dashes and colons.
