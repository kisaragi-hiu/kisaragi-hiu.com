Taxonomy, Taxonomy Terms

- tag → red → apple
- type → fruits → apple
- [[https://www.gwern.net/About#confidence-tags][confidence]] → likely → [a page]

The /tag/, /type/, and /confidence/ here are called Taxonomies.

Taxonomies contain Terms.

Terms in turn are added onto objects.

They in effect allow tagging objects not with just a list of tags, but with a map of keys and values.

[[https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/][Hugo supports this well.]]
