In UTAU, labels are a simple way to mark sections of the UST to easily jump around. I've been using them to make notes in the UST since [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNLT7WUuXHM][my メリュー cover]], and for marking sections since [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hnI8DqMVfc][my 濫觴生命 cover]].

For some reason, I've never seen a UST with section marks, even though I think they're quite helpful.

Label is a note property, this makes it useful for marking specific notes as well.

* Using labels

Right click on the top line where the bar numbers are, then select =Set Label Here=.

To remove or change a label, right click on it again then select the appropriate option.

To jump to a label, right click on the top line, select =Move=, then choose the label to jump to.

In this UST I've named various sections with labels (Intro, Verse, etc.) so I can easily jump to them. I also have a few labels marking specific notes, for instance =here= is what I use to mark my progress through the file, and =???= probably marks some notes sounding weird.
