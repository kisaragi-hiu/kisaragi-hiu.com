My system environment has been quite a mess this past month.

I used to put my environment variables in =~/.profile=. However, the variables suddenly stopped being applied one day. I tried to switch my display manager from sddm, to gdm, then to lightdm, to no avail. I know =~/.profile=, being essentially a bash script, is somewhat insecure; =~/.pam_environment= is also probably the right way going forward, so I started moving variables into it.

* Preprocessing =.pam_environment=

I had a piece of code in my =~/.profile= that checks Racket and Ruby's versions and sets the PATH to point to ~raco~ and ~gem~'s bin directory. =~/.pam_environment= alone can't do that, so I wrote a Pollen version of the file and rendered / compiled it into the final =~/.pam_environment=.

#+begin_src racket
◊(define (defpam_env name . contents)
   (define content (string-join contents ""))
   ◊string-append{◊|name| DEFAULT=◊|content|})

◊(define (pathlist-string . args)
   (string-join (string-split (string-join args "") "\n") ":"))

◊(define racket-version (version))
◊(define ruby-version
   ; this, or sed | cut? I don't know which I prefer really.
   ((compose1 first
              (λ ($1) (string-split $1 "p"))
              second
              (λ ($1) (string-split $1 " ")))
    (with-output-to-string (λ () (system "ruby --version")))))

◊; == directory shortcuts ==
◊defpam_env["XDG_DESKTOP_DIR"]{◊|HOME|/デスクトップ}
◊defpam_env["XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR"]{◊|HOME|/ダウンロード}
◊; ...

◊defpam_env["PATH"]{◊pathlist-string{
◊|HOME|/git/scripts
◊|HOME|/git/Sudocabulary
◊|HOME|/bin
◊|HOME|/.racket/◊|racket-version|/bin
◊|HOME|/.local/share/npm-global/bin
◊|HOME|/.gem/ruby/◊|ruby-version|/bin
$◊"{"PATH◊"}"
/usr/bin ◊; safety fallback
}}

◊; ...

◊defpam_env["VISUAL"]{nvim}
◊defpam_env["EDITOR"]{nvim}
#+end_src

I then ask KDE to render the file everytime I log out.

It's really ugly, but it only has one job, which it does fine.

* DEFAULT? OVERRIDE? =pam_env=, what?

All seemed well, until a few days later my PATH config isn't taking effect anymore. For some reason, every other variable is properly set, just not PATH. Trying to see just exactly which file those variables came from, I noticed a variable that is only present in my =~/.pam_environment=, telling me that it is indeed being read. I looked up info on PATH not being set with =.pam_environment=, and found [[https://superuser.com/questions/130135/why-doesnt-my-environment-variable-get-set][this StackExchange post]] hinting at something to do with the ~var DEFAULT=value~ syntax.

Reading into =pam_env='s documentation on the config format, it seems that ~DEFAULT~ is intended to be used for, well, defaults that could be overridden. Changing it into ~OVERRIDE~ seems to tell =pam_env= to just use the value and don't fiddle around.

#+begin_src racket
◊(define (defpam_env name . contents)
   (define content (string-join contents ""))
   ; DEFAULT -> OVERRIDE.
   ◊string-append{◊|name| OVERRIDE=◊|content|}
#+end_src
