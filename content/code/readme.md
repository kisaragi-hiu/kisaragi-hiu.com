# Code project listing

I treat project types as being distinct. Nobody wants to see an UTAU cover and https://aqi.tw shown in the same list, side-by-side.

I don’t think I’m overdoing it. eg. 2dcg and 3dcg are not split.

*2021-04-17T16:58:01+0900: But “covers” and “animation / visualization” are. …Just add different entrie, then, I guess.*

Frontmatter:

- title
- status (WIP, abandoned, etc.)
- tags

We also need to have a set list of status tags.

Maybe include an image thumbnail?

Existing files in projects/ will eventually be transferred over here.
