* Projects

- [[file:projects/kemdict.org][Kemdict]], my new flagship project. It provides a unified search interface for 5 dictionaries from the Taiwanese Ministry of Education, plus a space for me to try to fill in missing words or meanings. (This wouldn't need to exist if Wiktionary didn't consider Chinese languages as just one language.)
- [[file:projects/yabridgectl-emacs.org][yabridgectl-emacs]], a simple Emacs user interface for [[https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge][yabridge]], like an interactive version of =yabridgectl=.
- [[file:projects/org-import-simplenote.org][org-import-simplenote]]
- https://github.com/kisaragi-hiu/interris, a small interactive version of
- [[file:projects/ntoml.org][ntoml.el]], a half-done half-abandoned attempt to create a pure Emacs Lisp TOML 1.0 decoder / encoder. Not anywhere near usable.
- [[file:projects/tftt.org][tftt]], a 1-day project to play with a design I had in mind that day for visualizing trumpet fingerings interactively.

* Contributions

- [[https://github.com/oakmac/parinfer-elisp][parinfer-elisp]] (parinferlib.el, vendored by parinfer-mode): [[https://github.com/oakmac/parinfer-elisp/pull/14][Increase performance by 50%]]. [[https://github.com/DogLooksGood/parinfer-mode][parinfer-mode]] has been deprecated and archived, but I've been trying to maintain [[https://github.com/kisaragi-hiu/parinfer-mode][my own fork]] because I'm not used to parinfer-rust-mode; while looking for ways to speed up parinfer-mode, I also made some changes to parinfer-elisp that turned out to improve performance by a ton.
- [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/][Org-roam]]: [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/2221][Fix file modification detection failing in some edge cases]]
- [[https://github.com/search?p=1&q=is:closed+is:pr+author:kisaragi-hiu+archived:false+created:>2022-01-01&type=Issues][20 more drive-by PRs on GitHub that have been merged]]
- I started contributing =zh_TW= translations to KDE, including translating several pages in System Settings, translating KClock, etc.
- I also translated [[https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.gitlab.YaLTeR.Identity][Identity]] and [[https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.seadve.Kooha][Kooha]].
- I submitted [[https://invent.kde.org/sdk/lokalize/-/merge_requests/19][a patch to Lokalize to add case-insensitive search]] because searching across KDE translations was becoming too annoying without it. This took an afternoon of digging deep into Lokalize and its KDE dependencies to find a way to do it — thankfully Qt already provides a way to search case-insensitively, and I only had to hook it up — followed by some iterations and discussions with the maintainer. I'm particularly happy about this change, as I use it all the time while translating KDE.
